    <p id = "about"> The explorer's guide to the information ocean seeks to present information about a variety of topics, approaching the basis of scientific research in a way not yet 
        (or, at least, certainly not easily) found. We also have interest in expanding our areas of knowledge: so, if you like this idea and would like to contribute with knowledge
         of your area of research, please get in contact with us through <strong>MENU > CONTACT</strong>.</p>
